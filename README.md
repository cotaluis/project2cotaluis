# keep-in-tech
Keep-in-Tech is a website to help you stay in touch and up to date on the sports that interest you as well as write about your opinions you have about a game you just watched, or an upcoming game/event.

## Our Mission
We wanted all sports fans to join in on a blog created by sports fans for sports fans to share their own interests, and opinions and maybe even find new interests and form new opinions.

## Application Requirements
*Application uses a Node and Express back end and uses both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
*Application has a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the template engine.
*Application is backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM and protects API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
*Application includes user authentication (express-session and cookies).
*Application uses at least one new library, package, or technology not covered in class.
